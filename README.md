# FTProgressView

  FTProgressView is a subclass of UIView, which shows circle progress or pie progress. Feel free to run the demo and use it in your own projects.


### About coocapods: Someone before me used the name 'FTProgressView', so I have to use 'FTProgressView_FT'. and has moved to FTProgress

```ruby
pod 'FTProgressView_FT'
```

moved to FTProgress

```ruby
pod 'FTProgress'
```
